The data source (scraper) can be found at the repository [pcavana/Data-Management](https://github.com/pcavana/Data-Management).

## Normalization

In the database some strings are normalized.  
This is what normalization means in this project:

- All string to lowercase
- Trim initial and final space separator characters
